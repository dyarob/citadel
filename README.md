# The Citadel: A console-based ASCII game
JUST BEGINNING SECOND ITERATION\
\
The first time around we went as far as to 
having Ratmen hanging around freely in the 
hallways of our Citadel before the messy 
code failed us. It was possible to talk with 
a couple of NPCs like Goldenfingers, the 
cursed man.\
\
This time around we're restarting small, 
aiming for a more reliable code base.
